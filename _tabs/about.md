## From Blueprints to Big Data: My Journey 🚀

Hello! I'm an architect pivoting into the world of **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**. For years, my focus was on **structural integrity** and **spatial design** in the construction field. Now, I'm channeling that same passion for building, problem-solving, and precision into constructing intelligent systems and robust models.

This portfolio is the documentation of my ambitious career transition. I'm currently enrolled in an intensive 12-week upskilling course to become a Data Scientist and AI Specialist.

### My Core Passions & Projects 💡

My work—and my future professional life—sits at the intersection of three disciplines:

1.  **📐 Mathematics:** I'm a firm believer that math is the fundamental language of the universe and the backbone of AI. I am actively **self-studying** complex concepts (from linear algebra to differential equations) with the ultimate goal of returning to university to pursue a second undergraduate degree in Mathematics. You'll find my **learning logs** and tutorials here!
2.  **🎨 Art & Design:** My architectural background instilled a deep appreciation for aesthetics, visualization, and efficiency. I aim to apply this perspective to create elegant data visualizations and compelling user experiences for my AI projects.
3.  **💻 Programming & AI:** I'm building fluency in Python and modern data science tools. My projects focus on applying machine learning, deep learning, and statistical modeling to real-world challenges.

My projects here reflect a unique approach—where **computational thinking meets creative design**.

### Why the Change?

The decision to transition from a steady career in construction was driven by a powerful desire to work at the cutting edge of innovation. I realized that my aptitude for **logic, structure, and abstract thinking** was perfectly suited for the fields of data and AI.

My goal for this portfolio is simple: **to land my first professional role** as a Data Scientist or AI Specialist. I bring a unique blend of structural problem-solving and algorithmic curiosity, and I'm eager to contribute to a team where I can continue to learn and build.

Let's connect and build something intelligent together!
